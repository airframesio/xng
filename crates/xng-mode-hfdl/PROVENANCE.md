# Provenance — xng-mode-hfdl

Clean-room implementation from the protocol facts in docs/notes/HFDL.md:
ICAO Annex 10 Vol III Part I Chapter 11 (normative PHY, freely
published) cross-verified against dumphfdl (GPL-3 — **facts only; all
code re-derived** per docs/REFERENCES.md policy).

Key facts encoded: M-PSK 1800 sym/s Gray ring, +1440 Hz subcarrier,
SRRC α=0.31; burst anatomy (448-symbol pre-key, A1/A2 127-chip PN, M1
cyclic-shift rate signalling {72,82,113,123,61,103,93,9}, 15-symbol T
training 0x9AF); per-symbol π-flip scrambler (shared LFSR15 init,
120-bit truncation); K=7 171/133 convolutional code with rate-1/4 chip
doubling; 40×C interleaver (push column shift 17/23, pop row step 9);
byte bit-reversal between Viterbi and PDU layers; SPDU/MPDU/LPDU/HFNPDU
layouts with CRC-16/X-25 FCS; HFNPDU 0xFF enveloped ACARS through
xng-acars::block; 20-bit coordinate scaling ×180/2^19.

v1 demodulator divergence (documented): per-T-segment phase
re-estimation instead of dumphfdl's 15-tap LMS equalizer — adequate for
clean/strong signals and loopback; the equalizer is the planned upgrade
for real HF multipath. Scrambler output-bit convention and PDU bit
order flagged for verification against off-air captures (sigidwiki IQ
samples decodable by dumphfdl as ground truth).
